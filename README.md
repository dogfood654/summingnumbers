# summingnumbers
An easy way to know the addition to a number.

To those that do not know me, I am currently an accounting auditor. I work with numbers on a daily basis.
One day, I came to an issue where I have a list of numbers and I need to know which of the numbers add up to the number on hand.
There is an Excel formula but it takes way too long to produce the result I needed.
At that time, I was learning CS50 class and had the idea to create my own solver as Python is way more superior than Excel.

My first attempt was comparing the numbers on dimensions. (sum.py)
Basically, you compare 1:1 for all the numbers.
Then, compare 2:1 to all and continue until u add up all the numbers to compare.
However, it turns out that I would need to manually code for the number of dimensions needed.
I then stopped the project.

When I was working on my second project - tictactoe under AI - minimax, I came across a similar problem.
I need to produce all the possibilities of board and it would form a tree like diagram.
Then, I had an idea of producing all the possible patterns, ie the subset of all the numbers.
I also got stuck on the same thing.
This is reflected in my second attempt. (sum2.py)

Recently, I came across a few youtube videos on importance of data structures and algorithms.
After a few research, I found out that my problem can actually be resolved if I were to learn data structures, mainly the binary tree.
